    <h1>Pasta Dough</h1>
    <p>This is what I call my "base" pasta dough. I make this one the most because it's sturdy and flexibily
    meaning that it can rolled out very thin and not tear making it easy to handle. Its great for thin
    pasta or for ravioli's. You can adjust the recipe as much as you want, the
    rule of thumb is 1 egg for every 100 grams of flour.</p>
    <p>If this recipe turns out well for you, look into variations with
    additions such as egg yolks, parsley, or other herbs and spices!</p>

        <li>Roll out into a rough square with a thickness of less than a finger</li>
        <li>Feed through the pasta machine on the widest setting twice</li>

        <li>Roll out into thickness of less than a finger</li>
        <li>Feed through the pasta machine on the widest setting twice</li>
        <li>Feed through the pasta machine on the next-lower setting twice</li>
        <li>Fold into a "packet" to square the dough</li>
        <li>Roll out into thickness of less than a finger</li>
        <li>Feed through the pasta machine on the widest setting twice</li>
        <li>Repeat, incrementing down the settings on the machine until you reach the desired thickness</li>
        <li>If at any point the shape goes astray, just refold into a packet and start again</li>
        <li>When you have your sheet, create the pasta shape you want!</li>

    <h2>Detailed Instructions</h2>
    <p>First lets address the elephant in the room, I will admit I use a stand
    mixer for kneading. You can easily do all the kneading yourself, but I'm a
    man of technology and will take advantage of one of my favorite kitchen
    gadgets.</p>
    <img class="landscape" src="images/dough/dough1.jpg">
    <p>Regardless, measure out your flour and salt into your bowl. Make a well
    in the middle with a spoon and add your eggs and olive oil. It's okay if if
    the eggs overflow (like mine did).</p>
    <img src="images/dough/dough2.jpg">
    <p>If you are using a stand mixer, put on your dough hook and stir on low so
    it mixes the middle portion together.</p>
    <p>If you are using hands, stir the middle egg up with the flour, creating
    an ever-bigger well in the middle.</p>
    <img src="images/dough/dough3.jpg">
    <p>For those of you using hands, once you get to the outer edges, just fold
    the rest of the flour into the egg mixture. Give it a couple kneads in the
    bowl and turn out onto a surface and knead.</p>
    <p>For the kitchen aid cooks, you will have to stop the mixer and use a
    spatula to scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl to help the mixer
    along.</p>
    <img src="images/dough/dough4.jpg">
    <p>Whichever way you are kneading, depending on how big your eggs were or
    the humidity of your kitche, you may want to add a teaspoon or 2 of
    water if the dough seems a bit too dry.</p>
    <p>Eventually, after about 5-10 minutes of kneading the dough will start to
    come together. Stand mixers: you may have to scrape the bowl down a time or
    two in order to help bring the dough together.</p>
    <p>Eventually, the dough will become one cohesive mass and have a matte finish on the surface.</p>

        <img src="images/dough/dough7.jpg">
        <img src="images/dough/dough8.jpg">
    </div>
    <p>Roll out a large sheet of plastic wrap onto your work surface. Put your
    dough on it and form it into a ball.</p>
    <p>Tightly wrap with the plastic wrap. We don't want the ball to dry out.</p>
    <p>Let it rest at room temperature for about 40 minutes, or in the fridge for up to a day.</p>
    <img src="images/dough/dough9.jpg">
    <p>Meanwhile, get your work surface clean and equipment ready</p>
    <img class= "landscape" src="images/dough/dough12.jpg">
    <p>After resting, unwrap you dough and cut into 4 equal pieces. I like to
    prevent the dough drying out, so I'll work with one half before cutting the other.</p>
    <img src="images/dough/dough13.jpg">
    <p>Flour your surface and the top of your dough ball. Roll it out until its
    less than the thickness of your finger</p>
    <div class="pepper">
        <img src="images/dough/dough14.jpg">
        <img src="images/dough/dough15.jpg">
    </div>
    <p>Set you pasta machine to the widest setting and pass the dough through. Do this twice</p>
    <img src="images/dough/dough17.jpg">
    <p>If at any point the pasta gets too "sticky", sprinkle some flour on top
        and wipe off the excess. Do this for both sides.</p>
    <p>Your dough will look less like a blog and more of a really wide oval.
    This is what lamination is for. Fold the edges in and then the dough in half
    to make a "packet". This will help make the dough square shape the next time
    it goes through the machine.</p>
    <div class="pepper">
        <img src="images/dough/dough18.jpg">
        <img src="images/dough/dough19.jpg">
    </div>
    <p>Roll the dough out again, trying to keep a square shape. Pass through the
    machine again twice. Then change the setting to the next level smaller and
    pass the dough twice through this setting.</p>
    <p>This time the dough will look alittle more rectangular. Repeat the
    lamination and now you might have a shape with corners!</p>
    <p>If yours doesn't look so square, you can simply repeat the above steps.
    This can be true if at any time things go wrong.</p>
    <img src="images/dough/dough22.jpg">
    <p>Now again repeat above steps, but this time you can just stop the
    lamination and roll out the dough to the thickness you want. The dough is
    going to get very long as it gets thinner, so when handling it i will use
    the back of my hand to support it when feeding and grab it by the ugly
    ends.</p>
    <p>If it gets too long, just cut the dough in half, cover with plastic wrap and continue on with the other half</p>
    <div class="pepper">
        <img src="images/dough/dough26.jpg">
        <img src="images/dough/dough27.jpg">
        <img src="images/dough/dough28.jpg">
    </div>
    <p>When you are at your desired thickness, trim off the mishapen ends to
    square it. Now just shape the pasta into the shape you wanted!</p>
    <p>I have a linguine die that fits on the back of the pasta machine.</p>
    <p>After cutting I toss it with more flour to prevent the strands from
    sticking to each other and cover with pastic wrap.</p>
    <p>The pasta I don't immediately eat will be frozen in nests and kept in the
    freezer for the future! You can also dry pasta on a cooling rack as
    well.</p>
