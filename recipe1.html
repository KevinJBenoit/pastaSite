    <h1>Amatriciana</h1>
    <p>One of the most famous pasta sauces in Roman/Italian cuisine, this dish
    is traditionally made with cured porked cheek (guanciale), pecorino, and
    tomato. Guanciale isn't usually found in American stores, so I typically use
    bacon. Additionally, many of the variations I had in Rome involve a little bit
    of heat, so feel free to experiment with the red pepper flakes!</p>
    <p>This red sauce is my personal favorite of all of Italy, and with 5 common
    ingredients it's easy to prepare!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul id="ingredients">
        <li>100-150 grams smoked bacon</li>
        <li>400 grams whole San Marzano tomatoes with sauce</li>
        <li>Half glass of white wine</li>
        <li>75 grams pecorino romano cheese</li>
        <li>.5-2 teaspoons red chili pepper flakes(or less)</li>

    <h2>Detailed Instructions</h2>
    <p>Slice the bacon into 1/2 inch peices, you want to slowly render the fat
    out so that it's in the pan and not the meat.</p>
    <p>You don't want to stir the bacon too often though, you want to let some
    of the meat stick to the bottom of the pan to develop a "fond"</p>
    <img src="images/ama1.jpg">
    <p>Remove the bacon from the pan and add red chili pepper flakes.</p>
    <p>I know 1 teaspoon may seem like a lot, and it is! However the capsaicin
    which is responsible for the spiciness in food is hydrophoic, meaning its
    soluble in fat and alcohol. By frying up the flakes in fat(and again in wine
    later), you draw out the capsaicin into the dish and give your food a much more "even"
    heat that is far more pleasant than biting into a red pepper flake and
    getting a burst of heat that won't go away!</p>
    <p>However, I know spiciness is subjective to every eater, so feel free to
    lower the amount to something more comfortable if you desire. Regardless,
    cook the red pepper until the pan starts to shift colors, about 3-5 minutes.
    Make sure the pan is lower to avoid burning the pepper</p>

    </div>
    <p>Now we add your wine! Like I said before, this will help mellow out all
    that heat in the dish as well from the alochol in the wine.</p>
    <p>Using half a glass as a measurement is a quintessential trait of a traditional
    Italian grandmother (a "nonna") who never write down precise measurements in
    their food.</p>
    <p>*And one last note, please please please use a good bottle of wine! It
    doesn't have to be very expensive, but if you wouldn't drink it then why
    would put it in your food?</p>
    <p>Cook the sauce until it thickens up. A reduction of about half the volume
    is good, it could almost be described as a syrup.</p>
    <div class="pepper">
        <img src="images/ama6.jpg">
        <img src="images/ama7.jpg">
    </div>
    <p>Add in your tomatoes. Brining it to a simmer and cook for at least 20
    minutes. Have you heard of the saying "time is the best ingredient"? Well
    for many Italians cooking a red sauce for less than 20 minutes is almost
    sacrilegious.</p>
    <p>It takes time for the flavors to come together, so be patient!</p>
    <img src="images/ama11.jpg">
    <p>Alright, now its time to get your pasta cooking. Here's a great trick I
    learned: boil your pasta in a pan! It takes far less water, which means that
    getting that H20 to boil takes much less time! We also want to concentrate
    as much starch coming out of the pasta as possible. Store-bought spaghetti
    will just perfectly it in a 12 inch skillet.</p>
    <img src="images/ama12.jpg">
    <p>But back to that pasta water. The starchy water is what makes our sauce "creamy".
    Since our red sauce has been cooking for awhile, it needs some hydration to
    thin it out. So about halfway through your pasta cooking, take some water
    out and add it to pan.</p>
    <img src="images/ama13.jpg">
    <p>When your pasta is al dente, drag it out of the frying pan and into the
    fire...I mean sauce. Let some of the pasta water come along with it too, and
    reserve ther rest of the liquid.</p>
    <img src="images/ama14.jpg">
    <p>Crank the heat to high, add your cheese, and stir, stir, stir!</p>
    <div class="pepper">
        <img src="images/ama15.jpg">
        <img src="images/ama16.jpg">
    </div>
    <p>It's gonna look a little soupy and thin at first, but remember that the
    pasta still needs a minute or two to finish cooking. So enjoy the pasta
    facial while you stir. Add reserved liquid if needed. When the sauce looks
    thick and creamy  and pasta is cooked you are done! Serve it up!</p>
    <p>Garnish with some additional peccorino if you want. While you wait for it
    to cool here is a fun fact: </p>
    <p>Did you know that for my entire trip I never had parmesan with any of my
    food in Italy? Every restaurante I ate at used Peccorino Romano for their
    cheese. Maybe because it's cheaper, or maybe because the flavor is more
    salty. But whatever the reason I use Peccorino as my main pasta cheese
    now.</p>
